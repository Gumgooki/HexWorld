# HexWorld
Instead of making a hex-map from scratch, why not take inspiration from the very planet you live on? HexWorld allows you to transform the breathtaking terrain of Madre Terra into your own hex-maps. No need to stress about if your land formations are realistic, or if there really could be snow that close to the forest; Planet Earth has got your back!
